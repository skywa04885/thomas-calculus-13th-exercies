    "    Based on this information, we will put some definitions used further in this document bellow:\n",

    "    $f(x) = (3x - 7),\\ L = 2,\\ c = 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now we want to proof the limit by showing that if $x$ get's real close to $c$ that $f(x)$ will get real close to $L$. In this case, the 'how close' we are, will be stored in two variables, in which $\\delta$ will be how close $x$ is to $c$, and $\\epsilon$ will be how close $f(x)$ is to $L$. Also the following inequalities will be true.\n",

    "    Now first, we will find the open interval in which $x$ has to be, in order to have the output error smaller than $\\epsilon$.\n",

    "    $3 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} \\lt x \\lt \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} + 3$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Which tells us that, if we want to error to be less than $\\epsilon$ the input $x$ needs to be in the open interval $(3 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{3},\\  \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} + 3)$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Now $\\delta$ tells us how near $x$ should be to $c$ and that's why we want to calculate the distance from $c$ to both the endpoints, and then define delta to be the smallest of them. This is because $\\delta$ should be in between these values, which aren't always symmetric, and such we need to take the smallest one, which will still satisfy the open interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\delta = \\min{\\{ 3 - (3 - \\frac{\\epsilon}{3}),\\ (\\frac{\\epsilon}{3} + 3) - 3 \\}} = \\min{\\{ \\frac{\\epsilon}{3},\\ \\frac{\\epsilon}{3} \\}}$\n",
